>> To find the US male population in this range, we can first create a normal distribution with mean of 178cm and standard deviation of 7.7 cm . Our desired range is 5'10'' (70 inch or 177.8 cm) and 6'1'' (73 inch or 185.42 cm). Since we can assume that actual distribution of height is roughly normal, we can find what percentage of population falls between range 177.8 cm and 185.42 cm. We can find CDF(177.8) and subtract it from CDF(185.42). The resulting fraction is the fraction of male population in that height range.
